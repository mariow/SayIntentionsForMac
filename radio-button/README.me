Work in progress

Two additional scripts that will forward a button press on the joystick/yoke from Macos to windows and simulate a virtual gamepad on windows. This way Sayintentions on Windows can be triggered without being in the foreground.

=> everything works, it's just not well documented

TODO:
- [ ] clean up scripts
- [ ] provide usage instructions
